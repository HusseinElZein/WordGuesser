Beware of the traffic on my project! A lot of people seem to have been taking a look and cloning the project!

Here is a list of what I have implemented as:

Extra: 
Pause screen, win / lose screen. Main menu screen. Restart, continue game. 
And last but not least: A beautiful and thoughtful design

All of the following criteria are fulfilled:

1. The game is for one player.
2. When the game starts, a word is randomly chosen from predefined categories and displayed along with the category.
3. The word is displayed with the letters hidden.
4. The player “spins the wheel”. (A graphically spinning wheel is not required to be implemented this could be done simply by tapping a button and showing the result.)
5. The possible results of the “spinning the wheel” are: a number of points e.g 1000 or “bankrupt”.
6. In the event of a value being shown, a letter (consonant or vowel) is chosen by the user (from a keyboard or otherwise). If the letter is present, the user’s points total is incremented by the value shown times the number of occurrences of the letter. The occurrences of the letter are revealed in the word. If the letter is not present the user loses a “life”.
7. In the event of “bankrupt” being shown, the user loses all their points.
8. The “wheel is spun” until the game is won or lost.
9. The game is won when all the letters have been found and the user still has a life.
10. The game is lost when the user has no lives left and the word has not been found.
11. A user starts with 5 “lives”.
